# Hedron
An all-in-one 3D modelling & procedural generation crate

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer ðŸš§
Hedron is currently in an very early stage. 
I don't recommend you use this crate quite yet, as it is not at all stable or complete, 
but hopefully some of code provided can help you nonetheless!

## Use cases
- **Basic Modelling**: Hedron could be used to develop a 3D modelling tool, a very basic `blender` clone.

- **Procedural Geometry / 'Parametric Design'**: Hedron is intended for parametric modelling, akin to what can be done with Rhino & Grasshopper. 

- **Web Geometry Processing**: The crate can be complied to WebAssembly, allowing these operations to be used on the web.

## What it contains (or will contain)
- A full set of **geometry** models:
  - planar: `Line`, `Circle`, `Triangle`, ...
  - curves: `Polyline`, `Bezier`, `Spline`, ...
  - surfaces: `BezierSrf`, `SplineSrf`, ...
  - solids: `Mesh`, `Polyhedron`, `Solid` (TODO), ... 

- **operators** on those models: 
  - Point / Vector tools (Closest point) 
  - Transformations between the various models  
  - Modelling operations (`loft`, `inset`, `extrude`, `split`, `subdivide`) 
  - Intersections (intersect mesh with line) (TODO)
  - Boolean operators (join two solids) (TODO)

- Various extra **features**:
  - Direct [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) integration: `--features bevy` 
  - Obj / Mtl exporting 
  - Svg exporting (TODO)
  - Various mathematical tools to support the operations mentioned above.

# Design 
Hedron is designed to strike a balance between usability and expressiveness. It sacrifices A CGAL-level of expressivenes, in favor of a more simple and predictable API. 
Hedron strifes to recreate a suite of tools
