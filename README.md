# Hedron
An all-in-one 3D modelling & procedural generation crate

## ðŸš§ Disclaimer ðŸš§
Hedron is currently in an very early stage. 
I don't recommend you use this crate quite yet, as it is not at all stable or complete, 
but hopefully some of code provided can help you nonetheless!

## Use cases:
- **Basic Modelling**: Hedron could be used to develop a 3D modelling tool, a very basic `blender` clone.

- **Procedural Geometry / 'Parametric Design'**: Hedron is intended for parametric modelling, akin to what can be done with Rhino & Grasshopper. 

- **Web Geometry Processing**: The crate can be complied to WebAssembly, allowing these operations to be used on the web.

## What it contains / will contain:
Hedron strifes to recreate a suite of tools exposed by the parametric design tool called Grasshopper. 
However, any interesting procedural tools like perlin noise generation, or Wave Function Collapse, will also be added. 

It includes:

- **A variety of geometry models**:
  - planar: `Line`, `Circle`, `Triangle`, `Polygon` ...
  - curves: `Polyline`, `Bezier`, `Spline`, ...
  - surfaces: `BezierSrf`, `SplineSrf` (TODO), ...
  - solids: `Mesh`, `Polyhedron`, `Brep` (TODO), ... 

- **operators on those models**: 
  - Point / Vector tools (Closest point) 
  - Transformations between the various models  
  - Modelling operations (`loft`, `inset`, `extrude`, `split`, `subdivide`) 
  - Intersections (intersect mesh with line) (TODO)
  - Boolean operators (join two solids) (TODO)

- **Importers & Exporters**:
  - Direct [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) integration: `--features bevy` 
  - Obj + Mtl exporting 
  - Svg, Stl, Gltf importing & exporting (TODO): `--features svg stl gltf`
  - Various mathematical tools to support the operations mentioned above.

- **Various extra procedural tools**:
  - Marching cubes
  - Quadrilateral mesh deformation 
  - Perlin Noise generation
  - Wave Function Collapse (TODO)

# Design 
Hedron is designed to strike a balance between usability and expressiveness. It sacrifices A CGAL-level of expressivenes, in favor of a more simple and predictable API.
